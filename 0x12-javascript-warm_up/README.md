#Javascript Warm Up

In this chapter, i get my feet wet with Javascript. I want to learn how to make websites more interactive annd visually appealing,
which is precisely why i am learning this language.
I discovere that like python, it is a dynamic high level programming language. 
In this directory, you'll find some of the tasks i attempted in an effort to learn the basics of the language before i actually apply
my skills in web application development.
