# Javascript, Objects, scopes and Closures

After getting farmiliar with variable declaration, using process.argv to manipulate the 
command line arguments passed to a script file via node and struggling to conform with Javascript's
semistandard linter, i now have a solid base understanding of how to manipulate memory using JS.

I intend to widen the scope of my knowledge by learning about objects, scopes and closures within
this directory. Herein lies the tasks i attempted on this part of the journey.
